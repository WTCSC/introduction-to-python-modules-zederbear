# Text Utils Python Module

You are creating a Python module that will be used to perform various text processing operations. The module will be called `text_utils.py` and will contain the following functions:

1. `count_characters(text: str) -> int`: This function will take a string and return the number of words in the string.
2. `count_words(text: str) -> int`: This function will take a string and return the number of characters in the string.
3. `count_sentences(text: str) -> int`: This function will take a string and return the number of sentences in the string.

You will also import this module into a separate Python script called `average.py` and use it calculate the average number of words per line in a given file.

`average.py` _must_ return the average number of words per line in the following format in order for the tests to pass:

```
Average words per line: [average]
```
